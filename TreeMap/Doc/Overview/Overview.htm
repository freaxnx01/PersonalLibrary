<p>A treemap is a rendering of hierarchical data as a set of nested boxes, where 
each box corresponds to one data element.&nbsp; The nesting indicates the 
hierarchy, the box sizes are proportional to some attribute on each element, and 
the box colors are based on another attribute.&nbsp; Here is a sample treemap:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Images/SampleTreemap.GIF" width="663" height="280"></p>
<p>For a history of treemaps, see
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/index.shtml">Treemaps for Space-Constrained 
Visualization of
Hierarchies</a>, by Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland.&nbsp; Dr. Shneiderman
invented treemaps.

<p>The Microsoft Research Community Technologies team has developed two .NET 
components that render treemaps.&nbsp; The TreemapGenerator is a drawing 
engine without its own user interface. It takes a set of hierarchical data, 
generates a treemap from the data, and draws it onto a bitmap or Graphics object provided 
by the caller. It can be used in a variety of environments, including Web 
applications that generate images on the server for downloading to client 
browsers.</p>
<p>The TreemapControl wraps the TreemapGenerator into a Windows Forms control.&nbsp; It can be added to the Visual Studio toolbox and dropped 
into any Windows Forms application.</p>

<p class="SectionHeader"><a name="SampleApplication">Sample Application: Usenet 
Views</a></p>
<p> Usenet Views is a .NET Windows Forms application that displays Usenet statistics in 
a variety of graphical formats.&nbsp; Several 
of the application's views use the TreemapControl.&nbsp; Here, for example, is the microsoft.public newsgroup hierarchy 
displayed as a treemap:</p>

<p>
<img border="0" src="Images/SampleNetscanTreemap.gif" width="658" height="418"></p>
<p>In this example, the size of each newsgroup's box is proportional to the number of posts that 
were made to that newsgroup in September 2002.&nbsp; The color indicates the 
change from the previous month: green is more, red is fewer.&nbsp; The 
application lets you zoom into the hierarchy by double-clicking on the boxes.&nbsp; 
You can select which Usenet metrics to display, change the colors, alter the 
border widths and padding between boxes, save the treemap as an image or as XML, and so on.</p>
<p>Usenet Views is currently not available outside of Microsoft, but see the
<a href="http://netscan.research.microsoft.com/">Netscan</a> Web site for a 
related application.</p>
